Project for Big Data Analytics course.

Utilizing AI algorithms to analyze large amounts of data from many matches of CS:GO.
Naives Bayes was utilized to create a model that can predict which team is likely to win a round.
kNN was used to create a model that can predict whether a kill at a given location ismore likely to belong to one side or the other, then utilizing that model to create a "control map" illustrating the areas of each map that one side has more control over after generating a decision boundary.
